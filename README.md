This is an extreme subset of
[ui-grid.info]
(https://github.com/stormasm/ui-grid.info)

with nothing in
[docs/partials/tutorial]
(https://github.com/stormasm/ui-grid-examples/tree/master/top/docs/partials/tutorial)
except a couple relevant examples.

Note everything has been removed from here.

The comparison is everything that is initially
[here]
(https://github.com/stormasm/ui-grid.info/tree/master/docs/partials)

So api has been completely removed and almost everything out of tutorial.

More work has to be done to understand what all of the surrounding
infrastructure does...
